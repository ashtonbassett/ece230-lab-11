## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?

Edge sensitive circuits repsond to a change in a singal's voltage, while level sensitive respond to a specific voltage level.

### Why is it important to declare initial state?

Because when circuit powers up, the state of a flip-flop is random.

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?

It is used to build sequential digital systems.
